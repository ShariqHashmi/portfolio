                        <p>As the digital economy has grown and given rise to crypto
                            currencies, cases of cryptojacking are increasing exponentially. Your system could be
                            mining cryptocurrency for a stranger right now and you don’t even know about it.</p>
                        <p>With the increasing ratio of cryptojacking victims, you can’t help but to wonder whether
                            technology is a curse, especially when you are deeply immersed in the so-called

                        <p>Initially, I didn’t believe that cryptojacking was possible. But a few months earlier, my
                            faith in Cryptojacking started developing. My uncle told me that his newly bought laptop
                            performance was getting worse day by day – the cause, cryptojacking!</p>
                        <p>So if you received any strange email and found a malicious link offering some great deals
                            regarding cryptocurrencies, then we are 200% sure that this link might contain
                            cryptojacking code.</p>
                        <p>And if you already made a big mistake by clicking on that link, then get ready to face
                            some serious crawling speed and glitches on your system. With a heavy heart, you are now
                            a victim of cryptojacking. Your system will dedicate all the processing power towards
                            cryptojacking for someone else.</p>
                        <p>Now, are you looking for to prevent cryptojacking activity from your system? Do not
                            worry, as always, we are here to solve all your queries.</p>
                        <p>But before moving towards Cryptojacking solutions, let first quickly run through what is
                            Cryptojacking and then figure out is there any difference between Cryptojacking and
                            Cryptomining. Let’s go!</p>

                        <p>Just like a plane-hijacking scenario, where hijackers hijack the controlling part of the
                            plane, cockpit, to turn its direction towards their desired place, the process of
                            Cryptojacking is similar. As hijackers control the cockpit, these hackers hijack your
                            core processing power unit to mine cryptocurrency without letting you know.</p>
                        <p>In other words, cryptojacking is also known as a new form of cyber-attack that allows
                            hackers to use your system’s primary power to mine cryptocurrency without taking any
                            permission or acknowledgment.</p>
                        <p>We hope that until now you have some idea about what is crypto jacking. Moving on, do you
                            know why legal authorities don’t praise Cryptojacking but don’t have any issue with
                            Cryptomining?</p>
                        <h2><strong>Cryptojacking Definition </strong></h2>
                        <p>The process of Cryptojacking is explained as the illegal way or secret way to use
                            someone’s system to mine cryptocurrency.</p>
                        <p>Cryptojacking is the way that illegally accesses someone’s system by installing a mining
                            malware or program, which confidentially mines the cryptocurrency. Cryptojacking is
                            recognized as a cyber-attack in which anonymous hacker’s attacks and hijacks the user’s
                            system’s processing power unit to mine cryptocurrency without letting them know.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult for ordinary users to identify whether their system is hijacked by
                            hackers to mine cryptocurrency or not. However, various ways can help the users to
                            predict that their system is being used for Cryptojacking, which is later explained in
                            this blog.</p>
                        <h2>Cryptojacking vs. Cryptomining</h2>
                        <p>In simple words, when the process of Cryptomining is done illegally, then it turns into
                            cryptojacking. This means that without any legal authorization of using another system
                            or by hacking it, it turns it into Cryptojacking.</p>
                        <p>It means Cryptomining itself is not illegal, but the way you choose to mine
                            cryptocurrencies decides whether you are moving in the right direction or you are
                            involved in Cryptojacking.<br> <img

                        <p>Anonymous hackers use the process of cryptojacking by using your system without letting
                            you know. These hackers use multiple complex mathematical codes that couldn’t be
                            detected by any person, expect for those that have a fundamental knowledge about these
                            programming codes.</p>
                        <p>So, is there any way to save your system from unknown Cryptojacking activities? Will find
                            it out later but before that it is essential to understand how this Cryptojacking works
                            in a real life.</p>
                        <h2>How Does Cryptojacking Works</h2>
                        <p>There are two core methods mainly used by crypto hackers to use your system to mine
                            cryptocurrencies. So what are these two methods used by hackers for Cryptojacking?</p>
                        <h3>1.&nbsp; Loading Cryptojacking Codes in Your System via Email</h3>
                        <p>This method is to trick users by injecting Cryptojacking codes into their systems, which
                            is similar to phishing tactics. It means that in this method, a user will get a mail,
                            which looks similar to an authentic email and is near to impossible to differentiate
                            between the two.</p>
                        <p>So, due to close similarity in looks, it encourages the users to click on the link
                            provided in these fake emails. The links contains a Cryptomining codes on your system.
                            Now, these Cryptomining codes run in the background of your system as you use your
                            system.</p>
                        <h3>2.&nbsp; Injected Various Scripts on Different Domains or Websites</h3>
                        <p>Another method used by these hackers is through injecting a crypto script on different
                            websites. So, when to go on that specific crypto script infected website or the infected
                            banners, the crypto script starts executing automatically.</p>
                        <p>The major problem is in detecting whether these hackers use your system or not, because
                            not a single crypto script is directly stored on your system. There is a possibility
                            that hackers are using both methods on your system at the same time in a way to maximize
                            their return.</p>
                        <p>For example, first, they deliver a deadly virus on your system via email. When you search
                            for remedies to how to prevent this kind of virus, these hackers intelligently then
                            inject crypto codes on the same site where you probably find a cure. It means these
                            hackers use both methods to use your central system processor for mining
                            cryptocurrencies.</p>
                        <p><img class="img-fluid aligncenter wp-image-1271 size-full lazy-loaded"

                        <p>Moreover, these crypto hackers are so intelligent that they may analyze your activities;
                            whether you used email app frequently or love to go on new websites on a regular basis.
                            In that way, they figure it out how they can maximize their return by using your system
                            accordingly</p>
                        <h3>3.&nbsp; Hackers uses Browsing Mining Technique for Cryptojacking Purposes</h3>
                        <p>The reason why browsing mining is one of the best technique for hackers to do
                            Cryptojacking is that it doesn’t require any program to be installed for secretly mining
                            cryptocurrency.</p>
                        <p>The browser mining can be done by writing a Cryptojacking script such as Javascript that
                            enables the hackers to mine different cryptocurrencies due to its ability to use a part
                            of victim’s system processing unit without letting them know.</p>
                        <p>According to Investopedia, the official incident of Cryptojacking comes into notice when
                            a cybersecurity company “Panda,” wrote a Cryptojacking script by the name of “WannaMine”
                            had rolled out to different systems randomly. This Cryptojacking script is used for
                            mining of specific cryptocurrency known as “Monero.”</p>

                        <p>In short, browser mining is one of the best ways to do Cryptojacking and notably very
                            much serious issue for users all around the world regarding privacy and data safety
                            concerns. And this is also one of the reasons why Cryptojacking is not come under the
                            umbrella of a legal way to mine cryptocurrency and how it could be when the person
                            doesn’t know their system is using for mining purposes?</p>
                        <p>However, as per the digital marketing experts perspectives, browser mining technique has
                            the groundbreaking potential to use it as a substitute of advertisement monetization,
                            which could provide a way to recognized Cryptojacking process as a legal process.</p>
                        <p>Although, this kind of ideas seems to be very controversial as mining cryptocurrency on
                            the systems which are not designated for mining purposes could lead to a substantial
                            cost to users in the form of power consumption and damage to hardware.</p>
                        <p>However, these browser mining attacks are increasing exponentially, and still, there is
                            no potential remedy except preventing tips and precaution which are discussed later in
                            this blog.</p>
                        <h2>How to Prevent Cryptojacking</h2>
                        <p>According to our tech experts, here are some most amazing hacks to keep your system away
                            from Cryptojacking:</p>
                        <h3>Concentrate on Phishing Time Method On to Your System</h3>
                        <p>In reality, illegal online activities like Cryptojacking are something that could not be
                            resolved by a person who has very little knowledge about programming and coding.</p>
                        <p>Phishing means when someone attempts to obtain confidential information such as financial
                            details, credit card number, etc. for malicious reasons via sending e-mails, which are
                            similar too official emails. Moreover, this can also be done by showing ad banners on
                            different websites.</p>
                        <p>So, when you click the link available in the malicious email sent by crypto hackers, from
                            that moment these hackers get the access of your system to use it for Cryptojacking
                            purposes.</p>
                        <p>To prevent this phishing attacks, always double check about the offer you received via
                            email or ad banners by confirming through an official service provider.</p>
                        <h3>VPN Protects You against Cryptojacking</h3>
                        <p>VPN services have played a vital service to secure users online data and privacy.
                            However, there is no doubt that some of the VPN services had failed to fulfill their <a
                                    href="https://www.onlineprivacytips.co/news/ipvanish-helped-to-trace-suspect/"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">commitment regarding no logging policy. </a></p>
                        <p>By using renowned VPN services, this might help you much to keep your system safe from
                            these Cryptojacking activities. When you use a VPN, it keeps you secure from the eyes of
                            Cryptojacking hackers as your original IP address cannot be seen. In this way, these
                            hackers are unable to get the location of your system and failed to use it for
                            Cryptomining purposes.</p>
                        <h3>Ad blockers are very useful to Prevent Cryptojacking</h3>
                        <p>As we already explained that Cryptojacking codes mainly injected through ads on different
                            websites. Installing <a href="https://www.onlineprivacytips.co/reviews/stopad-review/"
                                                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad blockers</a> on your system
                            may help you in stopping these Cryptojacking activities.</p>
                        <p><strong>Note: Most of the free version Adblocker apps failed to block effectively, or
                                they offer to block ads on 1 to 5 websites at a time, which is not appropriate to
                                use. For this, we recommend you to use the paid version of strong ad blockers
                                available in the market</strong>.</p>

                        <h3>Use Endpoint Protection</h3>
                        <p>Here endpoint protection means antiviruses that offer crypto mining detecting feature in
                            their software. These antiviruses have one of the best features to protect your system
                            from Cryptojacking activities.</p>
                        <p>However, according to our experts, there is very high chance that paid antiviruses to
                            have the ability to detect these anonymous crypto mining activities, although hackers do
                            change their technique to avoid detection at the endpoint.</p>
                        <h3>Use Web Filtering Tools</h3>
                        <p>By using web-filtering tools, it dramatically helps you detect those pages that contain
                            Cryptojacking codes and scripts. In this way, you can protect yourself from being
                            trapped by crypto hackers by clicking on ads presented on different websites.</p>
                        <h3>Use Secure Browser Extensions</h3>
                        <p>We know that these browser extensions provide some great features that not a single
                            person does not want to use it. However, these browser extensions are one of the reasons
                            that offer a path to the crypto hacker to use on your system for mining purposes without
                            letting you know</p>
                        <p>So to keep your system safe from these crypto hackers, our tech expert recommend not to
                            use every extension available online. Always try to read the precautions of the app
                            before using it.</p>
                        <p>By using only secured extensions, the chance of keeping your system’s performance safe
                            and secure will significantly increase.</p>
                        <h3>Summing-Up</h3>
                        <p>The challenges regarding Cryptojacking keep rising as these crypto hackers always find
                            some ways to get access to our system without letting us know.</p>
                        <p>However, we think that we are also responsible for giving these hackers space to get
                            access of our system due to laziness by not following precautions like using reliable
                            software, apps, browser extensions, etc. This is one of the reasons how crypto hackers
                            always find a way to use your system without letting you know.</p>
                        <p>We hope this guide would help you much to understand what Cryptojacking is and how to
                            prevent it from your system.</p>
